## What is this app?

This is a Ruby on Rails app created to faciliate pet rentals directly from their owners. 

You can create and edit a user profile, rent a pet, list a pet you own, and delete said user profile. When searching for pet you can search by pet name or my owner. 

Some of the technolies played around with here are:

Devise
Active Storage
RestClient
Faker Gem

Styling:
Semantic UI and Customized CSS


## Installation

bundle install should do the trick. 


## Running

When you begin you will have to "Sign Up" as a user. 
Make sure to add money to your "wallet" on the Account Page to be able to rent any pets.
